In nature they can be found in various places, such as coastlines, seashells, and ferns, and even were used in creating certain types of antennas. The mathematical idea of fractals was known for quite some time, but they really began to be truly appreciated in the 1970's as advancements in computer graphics and some accidental discoveries lead researchers like Mandelbrot to stumble upon the truly mystifying visualizations that fractals possess. \n",
